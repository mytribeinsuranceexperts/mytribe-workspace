# myTribe Development Workspace - Claude Code Global Context

**Workspace-Level Memory for AI Assistance**

This file provides Claude Code with global context and preferences that apply across all repositories in the myTribe Development workspace.

---

## 🎯 Core Development Preferences

### Always Follow These Guidelines

1. **Latest Dependencies**
   - When suggesting packages or dependencies, always use the latest stable versions
   - Check for current versions rather than suggesting older packages
   - Mention if breaking changes exist between versions

2. **Communication Style**
   - Keep responses concise but factual - include important details, cut unnecessary explanation
   - Favor bulleted lists over long paragraphs
   - Use tables for comparisons and structured data
   - Avoid unnecessary emojis unless explicitly requested
   - In documentation: Remove completed reasoning, keep progress and deviations

3. **Documentation Organization**
   - **ALWAYS update existing docs** rather than creating new ones
   - Only create new documentation files when explicitly requested
   - Reference existing wiki docs rather than duplicating content
   - **Maintain living documents:** As work progresses, update relevant sections, remove completed reasoning, log progress and deviations from original plan
   - **Clean as you go:** Remove outdated information when updating files - don't just append to the bottom

4. **Memory Management**
   - Use `#` at start of message to quickly add to this memory file
   - Use `/memory` command to edit this file directly
   - Keep this file focused - don't bloat with hundreds of rules

5. **Documentation Policy - Living Documents**

   **Core principle:** Documentation should evolve with the project, not accumulate.

   **When updating documentation:**
   - ✅ Update the relevant section in existing docs (don't append to bottom)
   - ✅ Remove reasoning and context once task is completed
   - ✅ Log progress and any deviations from original plan
   - ✅ Delete or archive outdated information as you work
   - ✅ Keep information factual and concise

   **NEVER create:**
   - ❌ Post-task summary documents
   - ❌ Separate plan completion reports
   - ❌ Duplicate documentation in new files

   **ONLY create new files when:**
   - User explicitly requests: "Create a document for X"
   - No existing document covers this topic

```

### Shared Resources Location

**IMPORTANT:** All shared documentation is centralized in the Development Wiki to avoid duplication.

- **Roles:** `development-wiki/roles/` - AI agent roles for specialized tasks
  - doc-expert, senior-dev, qa-engineer, security-eng, devops, data-ml, etc.
- **Workflows:** `development-wiki/workflows/` - Standard processes
  - git-workflow.md, testing-strategy.md, deployment-checklist.md, version-bumping.md
- **Standards:** `development-wiki/standards/` - Code quality & conventions
  - code-quality.md, commit-conventions.md, security-practices.md, documentation-standards.md

📖 **See [development-wiki/README.md](development-wiki/README.md) for complete shared documentation**

---

## 🔄 Universal Development Workflow

**For ALL non-trivial tasks:** EXPLORE → PLAN → CODE → COMMIT

📖 **Full Details:** Use `/workflow` command for complete step-by-step guide

**Quick Reference:**
- **EXPLORE:** Read code, use Grep/Glob, review tests - don't write code yet
- **PLAN:** Outline solution, identify edge cases, get approval - don't skip this
- **CODE:** TDD when applicable, implement incrementally, run tests
- **COMMIT:** Conventional commits (`type: description`), update CHANGELOG

**Related Commands:**
- `/workflow` - Full development workflow
- `/tdd-guide` - Test-driven development
- `/commit-guide` - Git commit standards

---

## 🔐 Security-First Mindset

### Critical Rules (Apply to ALL Repos)

1. **Never commit secrets** - API keys, passwords, tokens, credentials
2. **Use environment variables** - Store secrets in `.env` files (outside repos)
3. **Validate all inputs** - Never trust user input
4. **Handle errors properly** - Don't expose sensitive info in error messages
5. **Review security implications** - Consider what could go wrong before implementing

### Before Implementing ANY Feature

1. Threat model - What could go wrong?
2. Write security tests - XSS, injection, auth bypass
3. Implement with security in mind - Input validation, output encoding
4. Peer review - Use `development-wiki/roles/security-eng.md`

📖 **See [development-wiki/standards/security-practices.md](development-wiki/standards/security-practices.md)**

---

## 📝 Commit Message Standards

**Format:** `<type>: <description>` (e.g., `feat: add login page`)

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, security

📖 **Full Guide:** Use `/commit-guide` command or see [development-wiki/standards/commit-conventions.md](development-wiki/standards/commit-conventions.md)

**Hierarchical Loading:**
1. This file (workspace-level) - Global rules and preferences
2. Project CLAUDE.md - Project-specific technical details
3. Subdirectory CLAUDE.md (if exists) - Most specific context

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Read before writing** - Understand existing code before making changes
2. **Plan before coding** - Think through solution before implementation
3. **Test thoroughly** - Write tests, run tests, verify behavior
4. **Security first** - Consider security implications of all changes
5. **Maintain living docs** - Update existing documentation as work progresses, remove completed tasks, log deviations
6. **Ask when unsure** - Better to ask than to guess incorrectly
7. **Use latest tools** - Prefer current versions of dependencies
8. **Keep it concise** - Short notes, lists, interlinked docs

---

## ⛔ Forbidden Directories

**NEVER read or search files in these locations:**
- `archive/` or `**/archive/` - Outdated documentation
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- `.vscode/extensions/` - IDE extensions
- `.git/` - Version control internals
- `.claude/file-history/`, `.claude/todos/`, `.claude/projects/` - Claude internals
- `.claude/shell-snapshots/`, `.claude/downloads/` - Temporary files

**Why:** Prevents context pollution, saves tokens, avoids outdated information

---

## ⚙️ Automated Code Quality Tools

### VS Code Extensions & Auto-Fix

**All repositories have automated code quality configured:**

**On Save Pipeline (runs automatically):**
1. **ESLint** - Fixes linting errors
2. **Organize Imports** - Removes unused, sorts alphabetically
3. **Prettier** - Formats code (spacing, quotes, semicolons)
4. **Trim Whitespace** - Removes trailing spaces
5. **Insert Final Newline** - Adds newline at end

**Python Tools (auto-format on save):**
- Black (formatter), Flake8 (linter), isort (import sorter)
- All configured in project settings

**TypeScript/JavaScript Tools:**
- ESLint (linting), Prettier (formatting)
- Auto-imports update when moving/renaming files

### What This Means for Claude

**DO:**
- ✅ Write code without worrying about formatting - tools handle it
- ✅ Trust that imports will be organized automatically
- ✅ Focus on logic and correctness, not style
- ✅ Verify settings work by checking `.vscode/settings.json` in each repo

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Manually format code to match style guides - auto-formatters do this
- ❌ Suggest running formatters unless they're failing
- ❌ Worry about line length, quote style, semicolons - tools enforce

**Extensions Installed:**
- ESLint, Prettier, Python (Black/Pylance), PowerShell, GitLens, Error Lens
- See `myTribe-Development.code-workspace` for complete list

📖 **Settings Details:** Each repo has `.vscode/settings.json` with project-specific config

## 🧠 Extended Reasoning

Use for complex problems requiring deep analysis:

- **"think"** → ~4,000 tokens (routine bugs, standard implementations)
- **"think hard" / "megathink"** → ~10,000 tokens (API integrations, moderate complexity)
- **"think harder" / "ultrathink"** → ~32,000 tokens (migrations, architecture decisions)

**When to use:**
- Architecture decisions and system design
- Complex refactoring with multiple dependencies
- Security threat modeling
- Performance optimization strategies
- Planning multi-step implementations

**Example:** "Think hard and propose 3 approaches for implementing caching across all Workers"

**Cost consideration:** Extended thinking consumes more tokens; use strategically

---

## 🗂️ Context Management

**Monitor token usage:** `/context` - Shows loaded files, token count, MCP calls

**Summarize & reset:** `/compact` - When context >50k tokens (preserves key info)

**Complete reset:** `/clear` - Between unrelated tasks

**Use `@filename` to:**
- Focus Claude on specific files (supports tab-completion)
- Avoid context pollution from irrelevant code
- Keep conversations focused on current task

**Signs context needs reset:**
- Responses reference old, unrelated discussions
- Repeating information from hours ago
- Mixing up different features/files
- Slower or less accurate responses

**Best practice:** One focused conversation per task, use `/compact` or `/clear` strategically

## ⚠️ AI Limitations & When NOT to Use

**Don't use AI for:**
- **Sequential dependent operations** - If Task B needs Task A's exact output, do manually
- **Deep domain regulations** - Insurance compliance, legal requirements (review required)
- **Blind trust on security** - Always manually review: SQL queries, auth logic, crypto
- **Highly sensitive decisions** - Deployment to production, data deletion

**AI Hallucinations:**
- May invent functions, libraries, or APIs that don't exist
- May reference outdated package versions or syntax
- Always verify: run the code, check docs, test thoroughly

**When in doubt:**
- Use AI to draft/propose
- You review and verify
- Run tests to confirm
- Manual approval for critical changes
