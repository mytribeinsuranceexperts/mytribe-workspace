# Claude Code 2025 Improvements - Implementation Log

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** In Progress
**Goal:** Optimize workspace CLAUDE.md for 2025 best practices

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive optimization of Claude Code setup to align with 2025 best practices, fix deprecated references, reduce token consumption, and improve context management.

**Starting State:** 484 lines
**Current State:** 540 lines (temporary - adding improvements)
**Target State:** ~150-200 lines

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Fixed Deprecated Tech Stack References ‚úÖ

**Lines Changed:** 69-70, 270-271

**Before:**
- `mytribe-ai-research-platform/  # Python, React, Google Cloud`
- `comparison-forms/  # HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript`

**After:**
- `mytribe-ai-research-platform/  # Python, React, PostgreSQL/Railway`
- `comparison-forms/  # React 19, TypeScript, Vite`

**Impact:** Accurate tech stack descriptions reflect current infrastructure

---

### 2. Removed "Legacy Roles" Label ‚úÖ

**Lines Changed:** 247

**Before:** "Legacy Roles (development-wiki/roles/)"

**After:** "Workspace Roles (development-wiki/roles/)"

**Rationale:** These roles are active and maintained, not legacy/deprecated

---

### 3. Added Forbidden Directories Section ‚úÖ

**Lines Added:** 295-305 (11 lines)

**Content:**
```markdown
## ‚õî Forbidden Directories

**NEVER read or search files in these locations:**
- `archive/` or `**/archive/` - Outdated documentation
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- `.vscode/extensions/` - IDE extensions
- `.git/` - Version control internals
- `.claude/file-history/`, `.claude/todos/`, `.claude/projects/` - Claude internals
- `.claude/shell-snapshots/`, `.claude/downloads/` - Temporary files

**Why:** Prevents context pollution, saves tokens, avoids outdated information
```

**Impact:** Major token savings by preventing Claude from reading irrelevant directories

---

### 4. Enhanced Extended Thinking with Token Budgets ‚úÖ

**Lines Changed:** 351-368

**Added:**
- `"think"` ‚Üí ~4,000 tokens (routine bugs, standard implementations)
- `"think hard" / "megathink"` ‚Üí ~10,000 tokens (API integrations, moderate complexity)
- `"think harder" / "ultrathink"` ‚Üí ~32,000 tokens (migrations, architecture decisions)
- Cost consideration note

**Impact:** Clear guidance on when to use each level of extended thinking

---

### 5. Improved Context Management Section ‚úÖ

**Lines Changed:** 372-391

**Added:**
- `/context` - Monitor token usage
- `/compact` - Summarize & reset when >50k tokens
- `/clear` - Complete reset between unrelated tasks

**Before:** Basic guidance on `/clear` only

**After:** Comprehensive context management with all three commands

**Impact:** Critical 2025 feature properly documented

---

### 6. Verified No TodoWrite Prohibitions ‚úÖ

**Search Result:** No matches found

**Action:** No changes needed - workspace CLAUDE.md doesn't prohibit TodoWrite

**Note:** Some project-level CLAUDE.md files may still have prohibitions (to review)

---

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS CHANGES

### 7. Review Project-Level CLAUDE.md Files

**Files to Review:**
- [ ] website-and-cloudflare/CLAUDE.md
