## File Comparison

| Aspect | Workspace Root CLAUDE.md | .claude/CLAUDE.md (corrupted) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Lines | 374 | 56 |
| Status | Complete, comprehensive | Minimal, corrupted |
| Last Updated | 2025-11-02 | 2025-11-03 |
| Purpose | Global workspace rules & context | Quick-reference (incomplete) |

## Content Analysis

The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file appeared to be an attempt at a minimal quick-reference version containing:
- Critical rules (abbreviated version)
- Workspace context summary
- Basic environment info
- Purpose statement: "Apply to ALL projects"

It was incomplete and corrupted, likely due to incomplete editing or truncation during file creation.

## Current State

The authoritative workspace documentation remains intact:
- **Location:** `C:\Users\chris\myTribe-Development\CLAUDE.md`
- **Status:** 374 lines, complete and comprehensive
- **Contents:** All global workspace rules, MCP tools guidance, security rules, commit format, agents directory reference, and workspace structure

## Restoration Options

If a minimal `.claude/CLAUDE.md` quick-reference is needed in the future:

1. **Create fresh version** - Extract critical rules from workspace root CLAUDE.md (rules 1-3 only, ~20 lines)
2. **Restore and repair** - Copy from archive and fix line 14 truncation
3. **No action** - Refer users directly to workspace root CLAUDE.md

## Preserved Artifacts

The corrupted file is preserved as:
- `.claude/archive/2025-11-03-corrupted-file/CLAUDE.md.corrupted`

For investigation or recovery purposes if needed.

## Recommendation

Keep workspace root `CLAUDE.md` as the single source of truth. If a quick-reference is needed in `.claude/`, create a fresh minimal version with critical rules only rather than attempting to recover this corrupted file.
