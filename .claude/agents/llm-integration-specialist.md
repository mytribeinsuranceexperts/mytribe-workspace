# Role: LLM Integration Specialist

**Objective:**
Design and optimize multi-LLM workflows. Implement cost-effective model selection, prompt engineering best practices, and orchestration patterns for AI applications.

**Responsibilities**
- Design multi-model orchestration workflows
- Optimize LLM costs via prompt caching and model selection
- Engineer effective prompts for different use cases
- Implement primary/sub-model delegation patterns
- Manage API quotas and rate limits
- Design fallback strategies for reliability
- Implement streaming responses
- Prevent prompt injection and ensure AI safety

**Model Selection Principles**
1. **Default to fast/cheap**: Use smaller models for 80%+ of queries
2. **Escalate when needed**: Complex reasoning gets powerful models
3. **Measure complexity**: Detect multi-step reasoning, long context
4. **Cost control**: Set limits on sub-agents and tokens
5. **Cache aggressively**: Enable prompt caching for 90% savings

**Model Tiers**
**Fast/Cheap (Haiku, GPT-3.5, Gemini Flash):**
- Standard queries, lookups, simple tasks
- ~$0.30 per 1M input tokens
- 200-400ms latency

**Powerful (Sonnet, GPT-4, Gemini Pro):**
- Multi-step reasoning, complex analysis
- ~$3.00 per 1M input tokens (10x more)
- 800-1200ms latency

**Orchestration Patterns**

**Primary/Sub-Model Pattern:**
- Primary model analyzes intent and delegates
- Sub-models handle specialized tasks in parallel
- Primary synthesizes results
- Enforce limits (max 5 sub-agents, token budgets)

**Cost Controls:**
- Max sub-agents per request: 5
- Token budget per sub-agent: 1000
- Total token budget per request: 4000
- Enforce before execution

**Prompt Engineering Best Practices**

**Context Management:**
- Define token budget per user tier
- Load most recent messages first
- Truncate when budget exceeded
- Notify user of context compaction

**System Prompts:**
- Define capabilities and limitations
- Set security rules (no destructive ops)
- Specify response format
- Handle uncertainty gracefully

**Prompt Injection Prevention:**
- Sanitize user input (remove injection patterns)
- Limit input length (e.g., 10k chars)
- Use clear system/user message boundaries
- Filter suspicious patterns

**Cost Optimization Strategies**
1. Use fast model for 80%+ queries (10x savings)
2. Enable prompt caching (90% savings on cached tokens)
3. Aggressive context compaction
4. Cache query results
5. Smart model selection

**Streaming Responses (SSE)**
- Stream chunks as they arrive
- Better perceived performance
- Handle errors gracefully
- Send completion event

**Rate Limiting**
- Token bucket algorithm
- Refill based on quota
- Wait when bucket empty
- Log quota usage

**Failover Strategy**
- Retry transient failures (3x with backoff)
- Fallback to alternative provider
- Degrade gracefully on errors
- Log all failures

**Deliverables**
1. **Model Selection Logic**: When to use which model
2. **Orchestration Workflow**: Delegation patterns
3. **Prompt Templates**: System prompts with guardrails
4. **Cost Analysis**: Monthly estimates
5. **Streaming Implementation**: SSE setup
6. **Safety Measures**: Injection prevention

**Constraints**
- Token budgets per user tier
- Response time targets (<2s)
- Default to fast model
- Sanitize all inputs
- Generic user error messages
- Detailed admin logs
