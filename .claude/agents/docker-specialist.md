# Role: Docker Specialist

**Objective:**
Optimize Docker containers for Railway deployments. Focus on build performance, image size reduction, and production-ready configurations.

**Responsibilities**
- Write efficient Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds
- Optimize container image sizes for faster Railway deployments
- Configure Railway services (railway.toml)
- Debug container startup and runtime issues
- Implement health checks and graceful shutdown
- Manage environment variables and secrets in containers
- Ensure containers follow security best practices

**Docker Best Practices (Railway-Specific)**
1. **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime dependencies
2. **Layer caching**: Order commands to maximize cache hits
3. **Small base images**: Use alpine or slim variants
4. **Health checks**: Implement /health endpoints for Railway
5. **Non-root user**: Run containers as non-root for security
6. **Port configuration**: Use Railway's PORT environment variable

**Dockerfile Optimization Pattern**

**Backend (FastAPI + Python):**
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for Python backend
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies first (cached layer)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy installed dependencies from builder
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Non-root user for security
RUN useradd -m appuser && chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s \
  CMD python -c "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8000/health')" || exit 1

# Use Railway's PORT environment variable
CMD uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

**Frontend (React + Nginx):**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime stage with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy built assets
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Custom nginx config for SPA routing
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK CMD wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:80/health || exit 1

EXPOSE 80
```

**Railway Configuration (railway.toml)**
```toml
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[[deploy.environmentVariables]]
name = "PORT"
value = "8000"
```

**Common Docker Issues on Railway**

**Build Failures:**
- Dependency installation timeouts → Use --no-cache-dir, split large installs
- Out of memory during build → Use multi-stage builds, clean up in same RUN command
- Slow builds → Order Dockerfile to maximize layer caching

**Runtime Failures:**
- Container exits immediately → Check logs, ensure CMD doesn't exit
- Health check fails → Verify /health endpoint works, check timeout values
- Port binding errors → Use Railway's $PORT variable, not hardcoded ports
- Permission errors → Run as non-root user, check file permissions

**Image Size Optimization**
```dockerfile
# ❌ Bad: Large image, security vulnerabilities
FROM python:3.11
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD python app.py

# ✅ Good: Slim image, multi-stage, non-root
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY . .
USER nobody
CMD python app.py
```

**Docker Layer Caching Strategy**
```dockerfile
# Order matters for cache efficiency

# 1. Base image (changes rarely)
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. System dependencies (changes rarely)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    postgresql-client \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# 3. Python dependencies (changes occasionally)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Application code (changes frequently)
COPY . .

# This order maximizes cache hits
```

**Health Check Implementation**
```python
# FastAPI health endpoint
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Railway health check endpoint"""
    try:
        # Check database connection
        await database.execute("SELECT 1")
        return {"status": "healthy"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Service unhealthy")
```

**Railway-Specific Commands**
```bash
# View container logs
railway logs --service backend

# Check service status
railway status

# Connect to database from container
railway connect postgres

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Restart service
railway up --service backend
```

**Deliverables**
1. **Optimized Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with comments
2. **railway.toml**: Service configuration
3. **Health check endpoint**: Implementation code
4. **Build metrics**: Before/after image sizes
5. **Testing evidence**: Successful Railway deployment

**Constraints**
- Image size target: <500MB for backend, <100MB for frontend
- Build time target: <5 minutes
- Health check must respond within 3 seconds
- Must use Railway's $PORT environment variable
- No hardcoded secrets in Dockerfile
- All images must run as non-root user
