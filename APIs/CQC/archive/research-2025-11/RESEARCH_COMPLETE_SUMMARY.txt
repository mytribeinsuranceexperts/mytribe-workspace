  CQC API COMPLIANCE RESEARCH - COMPLETE SUMMARY
================================================================================

RESEARCH DATE: 2025-11-02
STATUS: COMPLETE - All 5 critical questions answered
CONFIDENCE: HIGH (sourced from official CQC documentation)

================================================================================
  CRITICAL QUESTIONS: ANSWERED
================================================================================

QUESTION 1: RATE LIMITS
========================
Q: What are the exact rate limits? Is our ~10K API calls per sync (500-650
   calls/min over 15-20 minutes) acceptable?

A: NOT PUBLISHED BY CQC
   - CQC does not document rate limits publicly
   - No rate limit values found in official documentation
   - No HTTP rate limit headers documented
   - YOUR USAGE PATTERN: UNKNOWN IF ACCEPTABLE

ACTION REQUIRED: Email syndicationAPI@cqc.org.uk with specific rate limit questions
BLOCKING ISSUE: Cannot finalize implementation without this confirmation

---

QUESTION 2: API TERMS OF SERVICE (OGL v3.0)
=============================================
Q: OGL v3.0 requirements? Attribution? Commercial use allowed? Data refresh limits?

A: COMMERCIAL USE ALLOWED WITH MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION
   ✓ Commercial use: PERMITTED
   ✓ Data modification: PERMITTED
   ✓ Data redistribution: PERMITTED
   ✓ Attribution: MANDATORY on all pages using CQC data
   ✓ Data refresh: API updates daily; recommend 1x/day polling
   ✗ Logo use: RESTRICTED (only if authorized)

REQUIRED ATTRIBUTION TEXT:
"This data includes information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.
Source: Care Quality Commission (CQC)"

ACTION REQUIRED: Add attribution to UI footer before launch

---

QUESTION 3: TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
===================================
Q: TLS requirements? Authentication? API versioning? Deprecation policies?

A: TLS 1.2+ REQUIRED; API VERSIONING DOCUMENTED; POLICIES NOT DOCUMENTED
   ✓ TLS version: 1.2+ REQUIRED (1.0/1.1 deprecated)
   ✓ Authentication: Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header
   ✓ API endpoint: https://api.service.cqc.org.uk/public/v1/
   ✓ Credential storage: Environment variables ONLY (never in code)
   ✗ Deprecation policy: NOT DOCUMENTED
   ✗ Version notice period: NOT DOCUMENTED

ACTION REQUIRED:
- Verify TLS 1.2+ in HTTP client
- Ask CQC about deprecation/change notification process

---

QUESTION 4: SLA & AVAILABILITY
===============================
Q: Uptime guarantees? Maintenance windows? Incident notification?

A: NOT DOCUMENTED - MUST CONTACT CQC
   ✗ Uptime guarantee: NOT PUBLISHED
   ✗ Maintenance windows: NOT DOCUMENTED
   ✗ Status page: NOT PROVIDED
   ✗ Incident notification: NO PROCESS DOCUMENTED
   ✓ Support contact: syndicationAPI@cqc.org.uk (confirmed)

ACTION REQUIRED:
- Email CQC requesting SLA/availability guarantees
- Implement circuit breaker for resilience
- Set up caching for downtime scenarios

---

QUESTION 5: DATA USAGE RESTRICTIONS
====================================
Q: Storage duration limits? Data redistribution rules? GDPR compliance?

A: PUBLIC DATA; NO SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS
   ✓ Storage duration: NOT LIMITED (store indefinitely)
   ✓ Data caching: ALLOWED
   ✓ Data redistribution: ALLOWED (with attribution)
   ✓ GDPR compliance: PUBLIC DATA (no special handling needed)
   ✓ Commercial use: ALLOWED (with attribution)

ACTION REQUIRED: None - can proceed with storage and redistribution

================================================================================
  RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

RED (CRITICAL - MUST RESOLVE):
  🔴 Rate limits unknown - Your 500-650 req/min may exceed limits
     SOLUTION: Email CQC immediately (EMAIL_DRAFT.md provided)

  🔴 No SLA defined - API could be down indefinitely
     SOLUTION: Implement caching + circuit breaker

YELLOW (MEDIUM - PLAN MITIGATIONS):
  ⚠️  Deprecation policy undefined - Could break production
     SOLUTION: Monitor for updates, maintain fallback

GREEN (LOW RISK - APPROVED):
  ✅ Commercial use approved
  ✅ Data storage approved
  ✅ Attribution requirement clear
  ✅ TLS requirements met by all platforms

  ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

BLOCKING (MUST DO BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION):
  [ ] Send EMAIL_DRAFT.md to syndicationAPI@cqc.org.uk
      Expected response: 3-5 business days

HIGH PRIORITY (DO THIS WEEK):
  [ ] Read COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md (45 minutes)
  [ ] Add OGL v3.0 attribution to UI footer
  [ ] Store API credentials in environment variables
  [ ] Verify TLS 1.2+ in HTTP client configuration

MEDIUM PRIORITY (BEFORE DEVELOPMENT):
  [ ] Await CQC response to rate limit inquiry
  [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
  [ ] Plan daily sync schedule (2:00 AM UTC)

LOW PRIORITY (BEFORE LAUNCH):
  [ ] Load test with confirmed rate limits
  [ ] Test all error scenarios (401, 429, 500)
  [ ] Security audit on credential storage
  [ ] Compliance checklist final review

================================================================================
  KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

CONFIRMED (GREEN - READY TO PROCEED):
  ✅ Commercial use: ALLOWED (OGL v3.0)
  ✅ Data storage: ALLOWED (cache locally)
  ✅ Data redistribution: ALLOWED (with attribution)
  ✅ Daily refresh: RECOMMENDED (API updates daily)
  ✅ TLS 1.2+: REQUIRED AND ENFORCED (all platforms support)
  ✅ Attribution: MANDATORY (simple footer notice)

PENDING (YELLOW - MUST CONTACT CQC):
  ⚠️  Rate limits: NOT PUBLISHED
  ⚠️  SLA/uptime: NOT DOCUMENTED
  ⚠️  Maintenance windows: NOT DOCUMENTED
  ⚠️  Deprecation policy: NOT DOCUMENTED

IMPACTS:
  Your planned usage: 500-650 requests/minute for 15-20 minutes
  CQC documented limits: NONE EXIST
  Risk: Could violate undocumented limits in production

INTERIM SOLUTION: Conservative 1 request/second (60 req/min)
  - Safe but slower: ~2.8 hours instead of 15-20 minutes
  - Use while awaiting CQC confirmation
