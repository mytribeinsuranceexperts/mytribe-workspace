# Production Deployment - October 23, 2025 ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully deployed Phase 3 features (Enhanced Context & Analysis) from staging to production (main branch). Fixed critical backend issues preventing API functionality.

---

## What Was Deployed

### Features (27 commits from staging → main)
- **DataReferencePanel** - Dataset statistics displayed above query input
- **FollowUpSuggestions** - AI-generated follow-up question component (hidden pending redesign)
- **Stats API** - `GET /api/datasets/{name}/stats` endpoint
- **Follow-up API** - `POST /api/analyze/generate-followups` endpoint

### Database Migrations Applied
1. Query Audit Log Cache columns:
   - `results_json` (JSONB) - Raw query results
   - `html_table` (TEXT) - Formatted HTML output
   - `analysis_text` (TEXT) - AI analysis text
   - `table_heading` (TEXT) - Table heading cache
   - `chart_recommendation_json` (JSONB) - Chart recommendations

2. Data Profiles Table - Metadata caching for datasets

3. AI Models Table - Dynamic model selection with status:
   - Claude Haiku 4.5 (ACTIVE)
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (inactive)

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing `metadata` Column ❌→✅
**Problem:** Backend returned 500 error - `column query_audit_log.metadata does not exist`
- Model defined the column but it wasn't migrated to production
- Query history endpoint failed when trying to retrieve audit logs

**Solution:**
- Added JSONB `metadata` column to `query_audit_log` table
- Default value: `{}`
- Status: **VERIFIED - Column exists and working**

### Issue 2: Missing Admin Settings ❌→✅
**Problem:** Backend startup error - `AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'admin_email'`
- `startup.py` expected `admin_email`, `admin_password`, `admin_name` fields
- Config class was missing these optional settings

**Solution:**
- Added optional fields to `backend/app/config.py`:
  - `admin_email` (optional, default=None)
  - `admin_password` (optional, default=None)
  - `admin_name` (optional, default="Admin")
- Allows admin user creation to gracefully skip if not configured
- Commit: `5ed1263` pushed to main branch

---

## Current Status

✅ **Backend:** Fully operational
- All database tables present and correct
- Configuration complete
- API endpoints responding with 200/appropriate status codes
- Query history loads successfully
- New queries execute and save correctly

✅ **Frontend:** Deployed and working
- Loads without CORS errors
- Communicates with backend successfully
- Query execution and history display functional

✅ **Database:** All schemas in place
- All migrations applied
- All columns verified
- Query audit logs storing correctly

---

## Deployment Path (for future reference)

1. **Code Changes** → Commit and push to main
2. **Railway CI/CD** → GitHub webhook triggers backend build (Docker multi-stage)
3. **Frontend Build** → Vite compile, nginx serve
4. **Database Migrations** → Run via Railway CLI or manual SQL execution
5. **Verification** → Test API and frontend functionality

---

## Environment Configuration

All environment variables are properly set in Railway production:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - AI query execution
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - User authentication
- `DATABASE_URL` - Primary database connection
- `AI_QUERY_DATABASE_URL` - Restricted database user for AI queries
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend domain
- `BACKEND_URL` - Backend API domain
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Frontend domain for CORS

---

## Testing Performed

✅ Login functionality
✅ Query history loading
✅ Query execution with AI
✅ Frontend-backend communication
✅ Database connectivity
✅ Error handling and 500 error resolution

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Monitor query performance with new audit log caching
- Review FollowUpSuggestions UI/UX before re-enabling
- Test bulk query operations
- Monitor database size as audit logs grow
